Put your sports knowledge to the test with the ultimate sports trivia game - Long Shot. Two players take turns answering a variety of sports questions until one player scores three goals and comes out victorious.

## Rules
* Player one clicks on the box in the center of the scoreboard to start the match

* Two players take turns answering sports trivia questions (the top of the scoreboard indicates whose turn it is)

* The questions appear in the middle of the scoreboard and the player who is up has 15 seconds to choose from three possible answers

* If the player answers the question correctly, they   score a goal and receive one point

* If the player answers the question incorrectly, they do not score a goal and their points remain the same

* The players switch off answering questions until one player reaches 3 points   

* When a player reaches 3 points, they win the match and a new game can be played

* If no player reaches 3 points by the time the questions run out, the match is deemed a draw and the players have the option of starting a new game
